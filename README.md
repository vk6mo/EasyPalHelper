# EasyPalHelper
This program is intended to be used alongside EasyPal to provide
some additional functionality not originally included with
EasyPal and/or work around some of EasyPal's limitations.

The software is built using Labview, and requires the Labview runtime environment to run.
The installer includes the runtime.
